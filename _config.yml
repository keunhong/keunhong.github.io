# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a researcher in generative models and 3D computer vision. I am a founding member at [World Labs](https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog) where I lead the model pretraining efforts.
  I was previously a research scientist at [Google](https://ai.google/research/) where I built technology to [generate 3D assets](https://research.google/blog/bringing-3d-shoppable-products-online-with-generative-ai/) for products on Google Search.

  I received my Ph.D from the [University of Washington](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/) in 2021 where I was advised by
  [Ali Farhadi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ali/) and
  [Steve Seitz](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~seitz/).

  My current research focuses on "world models" through the marriage of diffusion models and 3D computer vision techniques.
